# Hotel-Management-System-Python-project

This Hotel Management System is a command-line application developed in Python. It is designed to simulate the core operations of a hotel by providing a structured and user-friendly environment for managing guests, bookings, corporate clients, and hotel services. The system is especially suitable for small-scale hotels or as a learning project for beginner programmers.

__Project Purpose__

The main goal of this project is to help hotel staff efficiently organize and maintain daily operations through a menu-driven interface. Instead of relying on complex databases, the system uses CSV files to store and retrieve data, making it lightweight, easily portable, and beginner-friendly.

__Key Functionalities__

__Guest Management__: Search guests by name or ID, view and update their check-in/check-out data, and ensure accurate tracking of room assignments.

__Corporate Client Handling__: Manage business clients, categorize them by company type, track their booking history, apply dynamic discounts, and update cooperation statuses.

__Booking Management__: Add and track future reservations, search bookings by name or check-in date, and avoid double-booking.

__Service Management__: List and describe hotel services such as spa, dining, and amenities with pricing, and allow staff to easily inform guests.

__CSV-Based Data Storage__: All data is stored in structured CSV files, including Guest.csv, Companies.csv, Future booking.csv, and Hotel_Services.csv.
